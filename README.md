# 🚨 RescueLink – Unified Repository

> **RescueLink** is a unified collection of repositories that power an end-to-end  
> **Android Based Road Accident Emergency Response System Employing Bluetooth Mesh Offline Relay**, designed to provide faster, smarter,
> and more reliable emergency coordination.

This repository serves as the **central hub** for all RescueLink services —  
including the **backend API**, **frontend web application**, and **mobile client**.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

RescueLink integrates modern web and mobile technologies to support:

- 📍 Real-time accident reporting with Offline Support
- 🚑 Emergency responder coordination
- 🗺️ Location-aware incident management
- 🔐 Secure authentication and role-based access
- 📊 Administrative monitoring and control

Built as part of an academic and applied research project, RescueLink aims to
improve emergency response efficiency, especially in areas with limited connectivity.
